How to contribute
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This extension is using the same contribution workflow as for TYPO3 Core, but
with GitHub PRs for the review process. Please read more about the workflow in
the
`TYPO3 wiki <https://wiki.typo3.org/Contribution_Walkthrough_Life_Of_A_Patch>`__.


.. _links-how-to-contribute-rules:

- Commit message complies to the `format used by TYPO3`_ (the "releases:" line
  is useless here)

.. [#] The term "patch" is used in the sense of "patch set" in Gerrit, and may
   be the result of multiple (amended) commits.
